# ü™ê Venus maps with elevation 
Here is 2 interactive maps of the surface of Venus, the data retrieved is coming from the NASA public website. The elevation data was extracted from the imagery that the Magellan JPL USGS team has distributed during the Parker's Solar probe flyby on 2021-02-20 at 20:11:30 UTC, that seems to be an enhanced version of Magellan Global C3-MDIR topography dating of 1990's.

I used [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) as well as [itowns-project](https://www.itowns-project.org/ "itowns project") for the post-processing of the files and in order to allow a 3-dimensional visualization of the surface of Venus. I have treated the source of the elevation file as a geoid file and translated it to geotiff 1 channel to apply the Z-factor feature.

The second part of this work was to add a 2nd layer (FLOAT32) to the first elevation surface, by doing this we can see a textured version of the planet's ground.
